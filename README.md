Assignment 3 of CSC7014 (The Practice of Programing)

## Assignment 3
Create a program that accepts a student's name and their grades for two subjects. The program should then determine 
whether the student has passed or failed based on the following simple criteria:
 - **Pass:** The student must have a grade of 50 or above in both subjects.
 - **Fail:** The student fails if they score below 50 in either of the two subjects.

---

## Requirements

1. **Input Student Information**
   - Ask the user for the student's name.
   - Then, prompt the user to enter two grades for the student (between 0 and 100)
2. **Evaluate Performance:**
   - Use an **if-else** statement to check if the students have passed or failed.
   - The student passes only if both grades are 50 or above.
3. **Display Results:**
   - After evaluating the grades, display the student's name and whether they passed or failed.
4. **Repeat for Multiple Students:**
   - Use a **while loop** or **for loop** to allow the user to input and multiple students until they decide to stop.

## Example Workflow:

1. **Input:**
    - Enter Student Name: John
    - Enter Grade 1: 60
    - Enter Grade 2: 80
2. **Output:**
    - John has passed.
3. **Input:**
    - Enter Student Name: Sarah
    - Enter Grade 1: 45
    - Enter Grade 2: 55
4. **Output:**
    - Sarah has failed

## Instructions:

1. **Step 1:** Create the logic for checking if a student has passed or failed using an if-else statement. The student 
should pass only if both grades are 50 or higher.
2. **Step 2:** Use a **while loop** or **for loop** to allow the user to input the name and grades for multiple 
students. Continue asking until the user decides to stop.
3. **Step 3:** Output the student's name and their result (pass/fail) after each evaluation.

---

## Deliverables:

1. **Source Code:** Submit the source code of you program.
2. **Screenshot:** Include at least one screenshot showing the program evaluating a student.
3. **Include your full Name**

---

## Grading Criteria:

- **Correctness:** Does the program correctly evaluate whether a student passes or fails based on their grades?
- **Use of Conditional Statements:** Is the if-else statement correctly implemented to handle pass/fail conditions?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code clean, organized, and easy to read?
- **Bonus:** Add basic input validation to ensure the grades are between 0 and 100.
