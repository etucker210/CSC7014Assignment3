 * Prompt: Create a program that accepts a student's name and their grades for two subjects.
 *         The program should then determine whether the student has passed or failed based
 *         on the following simple criteria:
 *         - Pass: The student must have a grade of 50 or above in both subjects.
 *         - Fail: The student fails if they score below 50 in either of the two subjects.
 *         More details on the prompt can be found in README.md
